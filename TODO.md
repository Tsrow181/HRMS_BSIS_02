# TODO: Implement Employee Shift Status Updates Based on Leave Status

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create `shift_status_functions.php` with functions to update employee shift statuses based on leave status
- [x] Add status column to `employee_shifts` table if it doesn't exist
- [x] Integrate shift status updates in `employee_leave.php` when submitting leave requests
- [x] Integrate shift status updates in `leave_requests.php` when approving/rejecting leave requests
- [x] Create `cron_job.php` for daily automated updates
- [x] Create `setup_cron_job.md` with instructions for setting up the cron job
- [x] Test the cron job manually to ensure it works correctly

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Set up the daily cron job on the server using the instructions in `setup_cron_job.md`
- [ ] Monitor the cron job logs to ensure it's running correctly
- [ ] Test the system by submitting and approving leave requests to verify shift status updates work in real-time
- [ ] Consider adding email notifications for shift status changes if needed
