## Files Modified
- ai_config.php - Removed hardcoded keys, load from secure file

- .gitignore - Added ai_keys.php and config.php

## Database Changes
- Uses existing assessment_scores (JSON) column for AI scores
- Uses existing notes (TEXT) column for AI analysis
- No schema changes required

## Breaking Changes
- IMPORTANT: Exposed API key must be revoked immediately
- Each installation now needs its own API keys
- Run setup_ai_keys.php or visit ai_keys_setup.php to configure

## Migration Guide
1. Revoke old API key at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Generate new API key
3. Visit /ai_keys_setup.php (admin login required)
4. Enter new API key and save
5. Select AI provider (mock/gemini/openai)

## Usage
1. Go to Job Applications page
2. Click any candidate card
3. Click "Run AI Screening" button
4. Review AI analysis (scores, strengths, concerns, questions)
5. Results persist in database

## Configuration
- Default provider: mock (no API needed)
- Change provider: Visit /ai_keys_setup.php
- API keys stored securely in ai_keys.php (not in git)

## Notes
- Mock provider works instantly without API keys
- Gemini has free tier (60 requests/minute)
- OpenAI is paid service
- AI results auto-load when reopening candidate modal
